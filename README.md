A React project built using NodeJS express, JWT, Mongoose & MongoDB that uses CRUD operations to a database as well as having user registration and authentication. Authentication is handled through JWT tokens through the backend API server. Passwords are encrypted and stored in the DB, as well as all other data. The concept for the site is to create a "picture gallery" which displays an image along with a title and descriptive text for it. Authenticated users can create/edit/delete pictures and components, while non-authenticated users can only view them.
